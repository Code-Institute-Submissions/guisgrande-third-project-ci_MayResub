# Three of a Kind Game

Three of a Kind Game it was developed with the intention to entertain the user/player, and force him/her to use his/her memory to make better decisions. It is a card game where the player faces the computer. Each player (user/computer) receives 4 cards, in each round has to discard an unwanted card and draw a new one from two options, current deck game (hidden) or discard deck (revealed), being able to take only the top card. The player who gets 3 of the same cards wins.

The game is deployed on Heroku and is strictly terminal-based for user interaction.

## UX/UI Design

### Strategy

#### Site owner goals

- The game targets those who are excited by card games and challenges. The game was designed to be a good hobbie and an alternative way to train your mind. People who are interested in different games and games that involve cards could be a potential audience.

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website, so I can know if it's of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site/game, so I don't get lost trying to navigate
- As a user, I want to be able to check my points and those of my opponent, to know my performance.
- As a user, I want to be able to restart the game, if it is in my interest to start again for some reason.

### Scope

For Three of a Kind Game I have planned the following features.
	- Use of the python language efficiently to make the game dont show any problems.
	- Through the terminal-based, display as clearly as possible the cards and dynamics of the game

### Structure

The Three of a Kind Game structure is based on a single static web page with the terminal-based to run the game.

### Skeleton

#### Flowchart

- The flowchart was elaborated to guide the development of the game steps.

### Surface

#### Colour scheme

- To make the game more intuitive and to highlight certain aspects such as suits, selection options or to highlight one information differently from another. I chose to use ANSI colors in the terminal.
