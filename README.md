# Three of a Kind Game

Three of a Kind Game it was developed with the intention to entertain the user/player, and force him/her to use his/her memory to make better decisions. It is a card game where the player faces the computer. Each player (user/computer) receives 4 cards, in each round has to discard an unwanted card and draw a new one from two options, current deck game (hidden) or discard deck (revealed), being able to take only the top card. The player who gets 3 of the same cards wins.

The game is deployed on Heroku and is strictly terminal-based for user interaction.

## UX/UI Design

### Strategy

#### Site owner goals

- The game targets those who are excited by card games and challenges. The game was designed to be a good hobbie and an alternative way to train your mind. People who are interested in different games and games that involve cards could be a potential audience.

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website, so I can know if it's of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site/game, so I don't get lost trying to navigate/play.
- As a user, I want to be able to check my points and those of my opponent, to know my performance.
- As a user, I want to be able to restart/quit the game, if it is in my interest to start again for some reason.

### Scope

For Three of a Kind Game I have planned the following features.
	- Use of the python language efficiently to make the game dont show any problems.
	- Through the terminal-based, display as clearly as possible the cards and dynamics of the game

### Structure

The Three of a Kind Game structure is based on a single static web page with the terminal-based to run the game.

### Skeleton

#### Flowchart

- The flowchart was elaborated to guide the development of the game steps.

### Surface

#### Colour scheme

- To make the game more intuitive and to highlight certain aspects such as suits, selection options or to highlight one information differently from another. I chose to use ANSI colors in the terminal.

## Features

### Existing Features

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

During these tests the size of the displays were adjusted, when to clean the terminal to keep the game fixed. In the end I found what I believe to be the most pleasing and intuitive look for the scope of a terminal-based game.

### Funcionality

Once the game was finished, I played it several times to find possible flaws or errors that could compromise the gameplay or interrupt the game. 
All commands are responding as they should, when some wrong selection is sent to the terminal, the answers are appearing to the user.
So far, when I finished and made the final deployment, the game is responding with no apparent errors.

### Navegation and Devices

With the project finished, I performed several tests on different browsers and different computers to check the playability and possible faults. No errors were presented during these tests
