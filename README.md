# Three of a Kind Game

Three of a Kind Game it was developed with the intention to entertain the user/player, and force him/her to use his/her memory to make better decisions. It is a card game where the player faces the computer. Each player (user/computer) receives 4 cards, in each round has to discard an unwanted card and draw a new one from two options, current deck game (hidden) or discard deck (revealed), being able to take only the top card. The player who gets 3 of the same cards wins.
